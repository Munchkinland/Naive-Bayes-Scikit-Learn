This repository contains code snippets and examples demonstrating the usage of a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier with scikit-learn. The implementation covers the following aspects:

Generate DataSets: Illustrates the process of generating synthetic datasets using scikit-learn's make_classification function, followed by the visualization of the dataset and the split into training and testing sets.

Creating training models: Demonstrates how to train a Gaussian Naive Bayes model on a generated dataset. The code includes fitting the model, making predictions, and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy and F1 score.

Model evaluation using confusion matrix: Provides insights into model performance through a confusion matrix. Metrics such as True Positive, False Negative, False Positive, and True Negative are calculated and visualized.

Naive Bayes Classifier - Loading data: Loads a real-world dataset ('loan_data.csv') using pandas, explores the data, and preprocesses it for training a Naive Bayes classifier.

Processing data: Covers data preprocessing steps, including one-hot encoding for categorical variables, preparing the dataset for training.

Creating training models (Loan Data): Trains a Gaussian Naive Bayes model on the loan dataset and evaluates its performance using accuracy and F1 score.

Model Evaluation Script (Loan Data): A script for evaluating the Naive Bayes model on the loan dataset, including accuracy and F1 score metrics.

True Positive, False Negative, False Positive, True Negative: Provides an interpretation of the confusion matrix results, explaining the significance of True Positive, False Negative, False Positive, and True Negative instances.

Optimize GaussianNB model - Hyperparameter tuning: Demonstrates the optimization of the Gaussian Naive Bayes model through hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. The best hyperparameters and improved model performance are displayed.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your specific use case. Contributions and suggestions are welcome! If you find this repository helpful, consider giving it a star. Thank you!
